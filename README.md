## 🚀 Why This Matters

Ever tried to understand your insurance policy? Medical discharge papers? A rental agreement? These documents are deliberately written to confuse you. **That stops now.**

This tool:

- ✅ Translates jargon into words humans actually use
- ⚠️ Flags the stuff that could hurt you
- 📋 Tells you exactly what to do next
- 🎯 Explains your actual rights and options
- 💪 Gives you the confidence to advocate for yourself

## 🔥 Real-World Impact

**Medical**: “Myocardial infarction” → “Heart attack” + “Ask your doctor about…”
**Insurance**: “Prior authorization required” → “You need approval first or you’ll pay full price”  
**Legal**: “Binding arbitration clause” → “⚠️ You give up your right to sue in court”
**Financial**: “Compound interest” → “Interest that earns interest (this adds up fast!)”
