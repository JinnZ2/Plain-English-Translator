# Contributing to Plain English Translator

Thank you for wanting to help make important documents understandable for everyone! This guide will help you contribute effectively.

## 🎯 Ways You Can Help

### 1. Add Medical Terms (Most Needed!)

Medical jargon is constantly evolving. Help us translate more terms:

```python
# In translator.py, find the medical section of _load_jargon_dictionary() and add:
'your_medical_term': 'plain english explanation',
```

**Examples we need:**

- Specialist terminology (cardiology, oncology, etc.)
- Medication names and effects
- Procedure descriptions
- Lab result interpretations

### 2. Add Legal Red Flags

Help us identify problematic legal language:

```python
# In translator.py, find the legal red_flag_phrases list and add:
'new predatory clause pattern',
```

**Examples:**

- Arbitration clauses
- Liability waivers
- Unreasonable penalties
- Rights you’re giving up

### 3. Insurance Decoder Improvements

Insurance companies love confusing language:

```python
# In translator.py, find the insurance section of _load_jargon_dictionary() and add:
'insurance_term': 'what it actually costs you',
```

### 4. Test Real Documents

**This is SUPER valuable** - try the tool on real documents and tell us:

- What worked well?
- What was confusing?
- What important stuff did we miss?

## 📋 Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- Test your changes with example documents

### Adding New Jargon Terms

Please include:

- **Plain English translation**
- **Context when it’s used**
- **Why it matters to patients/people**

Example:

```python
'bradycardia': 'slow heart rate (usually under 60 beats per minute)',
# Context: Often seen in cardiac monitoring, can be normal for athletes
# Why it matters: May indicate heart problems or medication effects
```

### Adding Red Flag Patterns

Include:

- **The problematic phrase**
- **Why it’s dangerous**
- **What people should do about it**

Example:

```python
'class action waiver',  # Prevents group lawsuits
# Why dangerous: You can't join with others to sue
# Action: Consider if individual lawsuit is realistic
```
